Donald Trump’s eldest son, Don Jr., is testifying in the New York civil fraud case against the family and their business, the Trump Organization. He is being pressed on his involvement in the financial documents at the center of the $250 million lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office.
Trump Jr. and his brother Eric are accused in the lawsuit of knowingly participating in a scheme to inflate their father’s net worth to obtain financial benefits like better loan and insurance policy terms.
Trump Jr. said he was not involved in the preparation of his father’s financial statements even though he was a trustee on Donald Trump’s revocable trust after he took office in 2017.
While the case is civil — and not criminal — it threatens Donald Trump's business in New York.
Court will resume at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday with Trump Jr. still on the stand. Eric Trump is expected to testify later in the day.
